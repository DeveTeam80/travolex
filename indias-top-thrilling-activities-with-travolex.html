                                                    Besides rappelling and rock climbing, many other adventure activities create a hub at the Western Ghats of Maharashtra. Water gushes down during the monsoon season from the cliffs of these places, thereby turning them into the perfect destination for any adventurer, especially for waterfall rappelling. You can check out popular spots at Lonavala and Malshej Ghat, where you can pitch your climbing skills against a backdrop of stunning landscapes.
