                                                The Mekong Delta paints an exquisite picture of the country’s rustic and attractive rural countryside and is undoubtedly one of Vietnam’s most alluring tourist destinations. One of the most popular and nicest things to do in South Vietnam is to cruise down this picturesque deltaic watercourse. Sail aboard a traditional Vietnamese boat in the Mekong Delta is a perfect delight for visitors.

                                                Cu Chi is famous for its remarkable subterranean tunnel network, constructed during the American and French War in 1940. This 250-kilometer-long tunnel web was built for communication purposes, including locked doors and hidden passages allowing a safe escape to surrounding streams, rivers, and canals. Many of the tunnels have been expanded and made accessible to tourists. People can crawl through them and get a sense of how residents used to hide in such a stifling environment.

The drinks are not only edible and harmless but also extremely good for one’s health.

                                                <h4 class="blog-titlee">By Sea</h4><br><br>
                                                Have you ever wondered what it would be like to travel in the manner of our forefathers? If you have leisure and want to spend a few days doing nothing but resting, a cruise to Vietnam might be for you. Nothing compares to the pure emptiness of relaxing aboard a beautiful ship, with every need met. While no direct cruises are available from India, there are various possibilities from Singapore. Choose any cruise for Ho Chi Minh City and spend a leisurely few day making your way across the deep sea, stopping at several ports along the way before arriving at your destination to continue your vacation. The cruise from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore takes approximately 9-10 days.<br><br>
                                                <h4 class="blog-titlee">By Air</h4><br><br>
                                                The distance between <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"><b>Vietnam</b></a></strong> and India is around 3,194 kilometers, and your flight time will be approximately 4 hours. With over 300 flights every week connecting the two countries, flying to Vietnam from Bangalore is the most convenient option. You can, however, fly from other important cities including Cochin, Delhi, Amritsar, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram. Vietnam has three international airports, and you can choose your port of arrival based on which section of the country most interests you. You can fly into Hanoi’s Noi Bai International Airport in the north, Ho Chi Minh City’s Tan Son Nhat International Airport in the south, or Da Nang International Airport in the center. The airport in Hanoi is around 40 minutes from the city center, whereas the airports in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang are 20 and 10 minutes. Although the airports are minor in comparison to other international airports, they all provide basic services like money exchange shops, food and ATMs. The advantage of smaller airports is that it becomes easier to navigate without getting lost or missing your connection flight. Vietnam also has strong domestic connectivity, and you may fly to any area of the nation from any of these airports.<br><br>
                                                <h4 class="blog-titlee">Wrapping Up</h4><br><br>
                                                Spring (February to April) and Autumn (August to October) are the most excellent times to visit Vietnam. Temperatures are more moderate, and rainfall is less intense. However, due to the country’s natural and ecological diversity, it is difficult to recommend a specific month or season to visit Vietnam. As a result, the optimum time to visit differs according to the many places to visit in Vietnam. Now that we’ve all learned about the best things to see and do in Vietnam, let’s start planning our next trip there right away.
