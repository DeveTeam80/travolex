                                                <p>Iceland is famous for its otherworldly landscapes, from active volcanoes to massive glaciers, but for adrenaline junkies, ice climbing on Vatnajökull Glacier is one of the most extreme activities you can experience. This glacier, one of Europe’s largest, offers incredible opportunities for both novice and experienced ice climbers to scale its frozen walls.

                                                The sense of accomplishment after reaching the top of an icy peak is unmatched, and the views of Iceland’s dramatic landscapes are worth every ounce of effort. Travolex’s Iceland <h2 class="h1h1">adventure packages</h2> include ice climbing excursions that combine the thrill of the climb with the stunning natural beauty of the country.
