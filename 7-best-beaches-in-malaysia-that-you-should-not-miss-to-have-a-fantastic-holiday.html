                                                    <p class="text sm-vbs">Dubbed as one of the <h2 class="sm-vbs">world's best diving destinations</h2>, Sipadan Island in Borneo is a real haven for divers. Wonderful sea turtles, barracudas, and reef sharks are just some of the objects that may be found underwater. Although you may not enjoy diving, the island's lovely beaches and clean waters make it a favorite place for relaxation. Effective conservation efforts only allow a certain number of visitors to enter the island on a given day, ensuring that this is protected for all time.
